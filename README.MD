# Clear Morning Storyboard

Feel free to take any part of the code in this project.

Idk what you're gonna do with it either you gonna use it in your own project,
just want to take a look, or use it to learn how to storyboard because some
people learn faster by examples than by tutorial/guide.

Credit not needed but I appreciate it if you do c:
